Freighter
=========

Freighter is not and will never be another JavaScript loader and module dependency solution, because [Sea.js](http://seajs.org) just did a great job on this. Sea.js is the best script loader I've ever seen and used. I think you should try it, too.

Unfortunately, if you can't read Chinese, you will find it's difficult to use Sea.js because It don't even has a English document! Therefore Sea.js is barely used outside of China despite how popular it is in Chinese web development community.

So here I am. I'll write a [connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/) middleware to show you my best practice of using Sea.js in node.js project and I'll talk about it on JSConfCN 2013, the äº¬JS conf which will be hold in Beijing this summer.

Sea.js In Short
---------------

Sea.js is a script loader implemented [CMD](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/Wrappings) ... Well, I'll add this section in the future.

Usage
-----

It's recommended to use Freighter in a new project, so let's just start one:

    npm install -g express # if you didn't install it before
    express example
    cd example
    npm install
    npm install --save freighter

add a file public/javascripts/string.js:

    exports.eeoo = function (str) {
      return str.replace(/EE/g, 'OO');
    }

and public/javascripts/beepboop.js:

    var str = require('string');
    console.log(str.eeoo('BEEP'));
    exports.more = function () {
      console.log(str.eeoo('BEEP BOP BEEP'));
    }

modify app.js to use Freighter:

    // ...
    var freighter = require('freighter');
    var app = express();
    // ...
    app.use(app.router);
    app.use(freighter());
    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

one more thing, add some lines in views/layout.jade:

    != js()
    script
      seajs.use('beepboop', function (bb) {
        bb.more();
      });

now run `node app.js` and visit [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) and open Developer Tools in your browser, you should see output like:

    BOOP
    BOOP BOP BOOP

Also, as you can see, `string.js` and `beepboop.js` is totally compatible with node.js, so you can use it in node.js directly, just try it yourself.

The RDD Strategy of Freighter
-----------------------------

Right now I'm developing Freighter using a [Readme-Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) strategy. So everything you read below, is my current focus and will be done in my next git push.

Planning
----------------

### v0.0.1b

Need some tests and travis-ci.

### v0.0.2

Serve coffee-script files.

It will also work with coffee script files, so if you change string.js to string.coffee:

    exports.eeoo = (str) ->
      str.replace(/EE/g, 'OO')

and beepboop.js to beepboop.coffee:

    {eeoo} = require('string')
    console.log(eeoo('BEEP'))
    exports.more = ->
      console.log(eeoo('BEEP BOP BEEP'))

It will also works.

How It Works
------------

Sorry, not today. I'll write it down after v0.0.2 published, maybe.
